# Notes Skeleton

## Setup

Clone this project and `cd` into the root directory.

Install `nodejs` and `npm`. [Instructions here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).

Install `webpack` globally:
```
npm install webpack -g
```

Install packages with `npm install`

Fire up `webpack` in a separate terminal window, to allow it to continuously build:
```
webpack --config webpack.config.js --watch --colors
```

To see your current app, point your browser of choice to the file URL of the `index.html` file in this project. Example:
```

And you're off :)
